## Summary
In this Cyber security plan, we first recognize the company's needs and identify the problems to be solved. We utilized the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) to fulfill the company's purpose. Lastly, we build a high-level architecture on AWS cloud to align with the company's purpose.
